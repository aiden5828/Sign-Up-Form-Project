You will work with a partner for this assignment. Please do this assignment without AI

Setup
Create a GitHub repository and liveshare with your partner to work on this assignment. You can look at previous assignments to refresh on how to do this.

Steps
1. Come up with an idea for a sign-up form for a company, non-profit, club, etc. It can be a real organization or one that you make up.

2. Brainstorm with your partner what type of information you would want to collect. Match them to the list of Required Form Elements (described at the bottom of this assignment), and write a comment in your HTML with your plans. For example:

first name - text input
age - number input
night shift vs day shift - radio buttons
...more

3. Look at the Required HTML Elements and Required CSS Elements. Make a rough plan with your partner on what content you want on your page and how you want it to look. Consider sketching a picture to plan.

4. Begin implementing! I recommend doing a small bit at a time, checking it against the HTML validator, checking that the data shows properly in the Google SheetLinks to an external site. when submitted, and fixing any issues as they come up. Then, move on to the next part.

5. When you're ready to submit, check one last time that your HTML passes the validator and your data properly shows up in the Google Sheet. Make sure your code is pushed to GitHub.

6. Enable GitHub pages and ensure your page shows up.

7. Paste a link to your page here on Canvas.

Required Functionality
Your HTML must pass the HTML validator with no errors or warnings: https://validator.w3.org/nu/Links to an external site.
